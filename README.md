This project is a command-line application developed for the Algorithm and Programming course. 
It is a data utility tool written in C that reads data from a .csv file and allows the user to perform several operations. 
The program is required to be in a single .C file and features a menu-driven interface with the following functions:

  1. **Display Data** -> Shows a user-specified number of rows from the dataset.
  2. **Search Data** -> Allows the user to find and display records by searching for a specific value within a chosen column.
  3. **Sort Data** -> Sorts the entire dataset based on a specific column in either ascending or descending order. After sorting, the program displays the first 10 rows of the sorted data.
  4. **Export Data** -> Saves the current data into a new .csv file with a filename provided by the user.
